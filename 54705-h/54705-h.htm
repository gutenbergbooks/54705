SARDOU AND HIS WORK
</h2>

<p class="spacer">
I
</p>

<p>
Victorien Sardou was born in Paris on September
7, 1831. His father, a native of the vicinity
of Cannes on the Mediterranean, came to Paris
in 1819 and followed a variety of scholastic pursuits.
His mother was a resident of the ancient
city of Troyes. Victorien&rsquo;s father finally engaged
in literary work, edited text books and taught
in schools. His interesting personality made for
him many friends. He never became well-to-do;
on the contrary, he became so entangled in indebtedness
that he gave up Paris and returned to his olive
groves in the south with the hope of being able to
satisfy his creditors. He left behind him Victorien,
aged twenty-two, who was struggling to displace
with studies in surgery and medicine his dreams of
becoming a poet and dramatist. But he could not
change his gods. A youth who had read before
he was twelve years old the works of Molière,
who had enthusiastically studied archæology and
important periods of the world&rsquo;s history and
who had delved deeply into all literature, especially
into the works of master poets and playwrights,
was not made of stuff moldable into something
other than his true self. Saddened by the
death of two sisters and left alone by his father,
Sardou continued his medical studies, meanwhile
residing in a garret. His existence would have
been extremely miserable had he not been able to
see an occasional play by Hugo, and to satisfy infrequently
his great passion for the opera. In referring
to those days of struggle, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t talk to me of music; that is one of
my passions. I remember a long time ago when I
went to the opera&mdash;not in a box of stalls, but right
up in the gallery&mdash;to hear &lsquo;<i>Les Huguenots</i>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>Le
Prophèté</i>&rsquo;&mdash;I delighted in Meyerbeer&mdash;the seats
were four francs apiece. I had probably pawned
my best coat to get there; but there I was, and I
never think of those costly evenings without remembering
how I enjoyed them, and felt a certain
sense of gratification that I have never experienced
since.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sardou&rsquo;s inspiration to follow literature began
with an incident which has often been related. In
a mood of wretchedness caused by poverty and the
caging of his ambitious soul in a bleak garret, he
stood in a doorway near the College of Medicine
to escape the rain and his thoughts turned to suicide.
Obsessed with this desire, he walked into
the storm. A water-carrier, who instantly took his
place of shelter, exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my friend, you do not know when you
are well off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An instant later a block of granite fell from the
building&mdash;which was under construction&mdash;and
killed the water carrier. Sardou accepted his escape
from death as an omen that he was destined
to live and to become great. Immediately he began
those several years of desperately hard work in
which he served apprenticeship for his future
career.
</p>

<p>
Of this period of Sardou&rsquo;s life a writer who
knew him well said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only those who have known the sting of bitter
want can fully appreciate the agony of the intellectual
student&rsquo;s career. The eager brain, the famished
body, the long night-watches and hideous
nightmares, the struggle to make both ends meet,
to keep body and soul together, the continual battle
with poverty, pride, ambition, hope and despair.
Sardou&rsquo;s young life was such a struggle. He possessed
a valiant soul, and he did not give way; the
more he had to work against, the harder he worked,
and every new trial fell like a pointless dart against
the steel armor of his resistance. He determined to
become some one, and he realized that the bridge
which spans greatness and nothingness is knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Desperate but enthusiastic, Sardou toiled with
his pen upon articles for a great variety of publications,
receiving poor pay, which he supplemented
with fees received for tutoring. He was a tireless
student. When he wrote upon topics pertaining
to history or to literature, he spoke with authority.
The Middle Ages, the Reformation and the great
events of the past which made and unmade nations
and their policies appealed to his poetic temperament.
He toiled day and night, and amassed an
amount of erudition seldom possessed by any but
scholars of renown. In the meantime he was working
upon his first plays.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These were the occasions when I could not afford
sardines and dry bread,&rdquo; said Sardou, &ldquo;and I
had to go to bed supperless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On April 1, 1854, the manager of the Odéon
Théâtre attempted to produce Sardou&rsquo;s play <i>Le
Taverne des Étudients</i>, which the crowd hissed from
the stage without witnessing it, and brought disappointment
and sorrow to the young author. With
the year 1857 came the earliest rewards for Sardou&rsquo;s
long years of labor: marriage and the route to success.
Poverty, lonesomeness, the cramped quarters
of a gloomy garret and the accompanying misery
and hopelessness of an unrealized ambition were not
enough: an illness of typhoid fever must bring
despair as a climax. On another floor in the house
resided Mlle. de Brécourt, an actress, and her
mother. When the young woman heard that the
quiet, studious young man whom she had often
seen was likely to die, her pity was roused and she
became his faithful nurse. In addition to saving
Sardou&rsquo;s life, she was the means of introducing him
to Madame Déjazet, who established the Théâtre-Déjazet.
In 1858 Sardou and Mlle. de Brécourt
were married. Sardou&rsquo;s plays found favor with
Déjazet, whose talents proved adaptable for portraying
his characters, and success followed success.
In 1861 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor.
Nine years after she had married Sardou&mdash;during
which time she had seen her husband attain fame
and wealth&mdash;Madame Sardou died. Sardou continued
to work and his fame became international.
Europe&rsquo;s greatest theaters were producing his plays.
In 1872 he was united in marriage with Mlle. Anna
Soulié, daughter of the curator of the museum in
Versailles. The marriage was extremely happy and
the dramatist&rsquo;s success continued. In 1877 Sardou
was elected a member of the French Academy.
Though immensely wealthy, Sardou resided simply
at his villa in Marley-le-Roi near Versailles. He
also had two country homes near Cannes, where
his forefathers lived, and a residence in Paris,
which he occupied principally for business purposes.
Like Scott, Sardou had a great passion for books
upon every subject, and his home at Marley, like
Abbotsford, contained thousands of volumes.
Honors from literary and art societies throughout
Europe came to him. In making appointments to
posts in which a knowledge of literature and the
fine arts were important qualifications, the French
government consulted with Sardou, who was considered
an authority. The productive years of his
life were serene ones. He was very generous, always
ready to encourage the aspirant, and had no
jealousies. His was a remarkable personality. The
late Edmondo de Amicis thus describes him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sardou looked a little like Napoleon, a little
like Voltaire and a little like the smiling portrait
of a malicious actress which I had seen in a shop
window on the previous day. He wore a large black
velvet cap, below which fell long waving gray locks.
He had a silk hankerchief round his neck and was
wrapped in a wide dark-colored jacket, which looked
like a demi-dressing gown. My attention was riveted
by his strange face, without beard and colorless,
with a long nose and pointed chin and irregular and
strongly marked features, lighted up by two keenly
sparkling gray eyes, full of thought, the glances of
which correspond with the rapid motion of the thin
and flexible lips, and the acute yet kindly expression
of the whole face, sometimes illumined by a bright,
slightly mocking smile, like that of a quite young
man. He did not look more than 70 years of
age, and when he spoke he seemed still younger.
He spoke with the fluency of an actor who abuses
that power. It was not necessary to question Sardou.
He began to converse with a fluency, an ease
and a vivacity of accent and gesture which forestalled
all my questions and satisfied my curiosity
with such an appearance of intimacy and confidence
that I was at first quite stunned, uncertain whether
I was in the presence of the most expansive and
frankest man I had ever met or of the profoundest
and cleverest actor that the human mind can
imagine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In his seventy-eighth year, at the time when he
received the news of the success of his last play,
<i>L&rsquo;Affaire des Poisons</i>, Sardou, who had been convalescing
from an illness of pulmonary congestion,
became suddenly worse and died in Paris on November
8, 1908. His funeral was held on November
11 in the Church of St. François de Sales. The
obsequies were national in character. Like all those
who had received the Grand Cross of the Legion
of Honor, Sardou was given a military burial.
Previous to the removal of the body from the house
to the church, eulogies were delivered before
Sardou&rsquo;s intimate friends and members of the
Academy. Those present were Frenchmen distinguished
in art, literature, science and politics.
Thousands of persons representing every class of
Parisian life&mdash;for Sardou&rsquo;s name was known alike
in mansion and tenement&mdash;stood with lifted hats
as the funeral procession passed on its way to Marley,
and thousands followed the hearse to the family
burial place. From all parts of the world telegrams
of condolence were received by M. Sardou&rsquo;s family.
From Cairo Madame Sarah Bernhardt, whose fame
resulted from her interpretations of the characters
in Sardou&rsquo;s plays, cabled: &ldquo;France loses one of its
glories, Paris a friend, all the unhappy a protector,
and we artists our beloved master, Victorien
Sardou.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="spacer">
II
</p>

<p>
Among those who discuss the drama there is a
tendency to depreciate Sardou&rsquo;s work. Such an
attitude is probably only natural during a time
when homage is so universally directed to such
realists and dissectors of modern social life as Ibsen,
Pinero, Brieux, Hervieu and Shaw. The principal
complaint brought against Sardou is the charge that
he made mechanical plays in which all material was
subordinated to the plot, that his characters are like
marionettes made vocal and that he &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo;
theatrical pieces to portray the talents of certain
histrionic &ldquo;stars.&rdquo; If these qualities alone are the
basis for condemnation of Sardou&rsquo;s plays, something
more must be offered to convince the public that he
is not fit to stand among the modern master
dramatists. If they are requirements necessary for
a playwright to attain a world-wide reputation, to
become a member of the celebrated Academy and
of numerous other societies in which high scholarship
is demanded for admission, one questions the
consistency of the statements of the critics; if plays
containing these qualities, presented by actors and
actresses of international fame in the world&rsquo;s principal
centers of culture&mdash;where a play by Sardou
was an important public event&mdash;realized for their
creator during several decades the goal of every
playrwright: success, fame and the accompanying
financial reward, then one not only questions the
consistency of the critics but also their qualifications
for posing as &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; on the drama.
</p>

<p>
It is popular to depreciate Sardou, but much of
this depreciation would become admiration were
it not for the fact that for those who do not read
French only a few of his plays are available in translations.
Students of the drama, therefore, are compelled
to accept the opinions of others instead of
basing their knowledge upon a first-hand acquaintance
with Sardou&rsquo;s work. His high position among
the dramatists of France alone would demand an
explanation of the reasons why his productions appealed
to cultured and cosmopolitan audiences, which
included scholars, diplomats, royalty&mdash;persons not
likely to waste time in flocking to see the work of
a mediocrist.
</p>

<p>
No one in the world ever understood better the
technique of playwriting than did Sardou. Both
he and Ibsen recognized Scribe&rsquo;s genius for technique:
Sardou acquired Scribe&rsquo;s craftsmanship, developed
it and improved upon it; Ibsen used of it
what he could in his clinical excursions into the
whys and wherefores of Life&mdash;the one reflected the
French spirit, the heritage of the epic and romantic
past, the social life preceding the fall of the Second
Empire and the national life since then; the other,
grimly Teutonic in temperament, mined to the roots
of human life and ironically upheld the mirror to
all classes revealing the secrets of their souls. Into
lighted streets, into halls and mansions, into courts
and capitols, into palaces and into throne-rooms,
Sardou passed studying minutely the movements of
his personages; Ibsen, with the attentive scrutiny
of a hospital aide seeking the wounded, turned his
flash-light&mdash;a flash-light with microscopic power&mdash;into
dark corners, into alleys, into humanity&rsquo;s every
haunt. The great Frenchman and the great Norwegian
both studied medicine and gave it up before
becoming playwrights. Their selections of working
materials were truly characteristic of their national
temperaments. Both have had an inestimable influence
upon the drama of all nations.
</p>

<p>
Sardou was structural in his craftsmanship in
the sense that he created his plays with the skill
of an artisan working with steel and stone, and
eliminated everything unnecessary in making his production
symmetrical. He was a realist in the sense
that he never hesitated to portray what he thought
would convey his idea complete to the audience. If
a thrill of horror would effectively drive home a
point, he used it. In his satirical plays he was
merciless in handling the vanities and vagaries of
society. While Sardou aspired to become a playwright,
he studied Shakespeare and regarded verse
as the best medium for presenting lofty themes, but
after he studied the stage he changed this view and
wrote his principal plays in prose, though the material
is often admirably adapted for metrical expression.
Sardou&rsquo;s historical dramas are lofty in
theme. They are true to their times, and appeal
universally to those interested in life outcropping
from mighty changes of conditions in the past. His
deep knowledge of history, art and archæology is
evident in historical dramas in which costumes,
decorations, interior details, furniture and other
properties used for the setting compositely reproduce
the atmosphere of the period depicted by the action.
None knew better than Sardou the life about him.
He studied personalities in their intricate relationship
in society. He never preached. He never
sacrificed plot in order to prove a thesis, thereby
escaping the prolixity of which some of the &ldquo;realists&rdquo;
are often guilty. His plays have morals, but
they are skillfully hidden behind his technique,
which supplements a natural gift of analysis and
an intuitive power for recognizing and selecting subject
matter pleasing to cosmopolitan Parisian audiences.
His comedies portraying contemporary life
were, with a few exceptions, enthusiastically received,
and were the stepping stones by which actors
and actresses rose to world-wide celebrity. For
impressive compositions Verdi and Offenbach found
inspiration in Sardou&rsquo;s creations.
</p>

<p>
The result of Sardou&rsquo;s long years of hard work
was a prolific production of comedies and dramas.
The principal ones and the dates of their production
were as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>La Taverne des Étudiants, 1854; Les Premières
Armes de Figaro, 1859; Les Pattes de Mouche,
1860; Nos Intimes, 1861; La Papillonne, 1862;
Les Vieux Garçons, 1865; Patrie!, 1869; Fernande,
1870; Andréa, 1873; La Haine, 1874; Daniel
Rochat, 1880; Divorçons, 1880; Theodora, 1884;
La Tosca, 1887; Cléopâtre, 1890; Thermidor,
1891; Madame Sans-Gene, 1893; Gismonda, 1894;
Paméla, 1898; Robespierre, 1899; Dante, 1903;
La Sorcière, 1903; L&rsquo;Affaire des Poisons, 1907.</i>
</p>

<p class="spacer">
III
</p>

<p>
Sardou&rsquo;s marvelous theatrical technique is nowhere
better exemplified than in <i>La Sorcière</i>, one of
his last tragedies. Bigotry, love, superstition and
persecution are the predominating elements of the
action, which is laid in Granada immediately after
the conquest by the Spaniards. What better material
for romance? The principal figures are a Castilian
officer and a cultured Moorish woman, who,
ignoring an edict of the Inquisition inflicting the
death penalty upon alliances between Christians and
unconverted Moslems, have the strength to assert
their rights as normal human beings&mdash;and to suffer
the inevitable consequences. It is the depiction
of a struggle for individual freedom in which the
common truths of the human heart beat hopelessly
for expression against the bigotry of the masses and
the bigotry of those who not only know better but
who also use it as an agency in strengthening their
own power. The result is the old struggle between
knowledge and ignorance, between love for one&rsquo;s
religion and country and for the satisfaction of
the soul&rsquo;s desire regardless of traditions discarded
and of idols knocked down in the accomplishment of
that desire. In this process of emerging, of transition,
in this sudden seizure by unknown forces upon
new combinations of circumstances, in this bidding
farewell to the old while hailing with allegiance
that of which we are unaware until the clarifying
moment arrives, lies the essence of tragedy. &ldquo;It is
possible,&rdquo; said the late William James, &ldquo;that Being
may be a great sea of consciousness, some of the
fag ends of which are human minds.&rdquo; It is in the
interplay, in the constant weaving and raveling
of that cosmic pattern which we call life that the
dramatist finds the few wisps of experience suitable
for interpreting his own understanding of a certain
phase of existence. &ldquo;The representation of a great
misfortune alone is essential to tragedy,&rdquo; declared
Schopenhauer. &ldquo;Characters of ordinary morality,
under circumstances such as often occur, are so
situated with regard to each other that their position
compels them, knowingly and with their eyes
open, to do each other the greatest injury without
any of them being entirely in the wrong.&rdquo; Under
this definition, <i>La Socrière</i> qualifies exactly as a
tragedy.
</p>

<p>
In creating his plays Sardou did not attempt to
conform to any particular definition. He was independent
in choice of materials and in method of
handling: the purpose justified the treatment. In
<i>La Sorcière</i> he showed his hatred of tyranny, and
he puts into the mouth of Zoraya, the Moorish
woman, in that powerful seventh scene of Act IV,
one of the bitterest denunciations of the Inquisition
ever made through the drama. Sardou studied historic
events with the eyes of a scientist. He was
interested in hypnotism and in spiritualism. While
studying the Middle Ages he concluded that the so-called
sorcery of that time was nothing else but
hypnotism, long known to the Orientals and introduced
by them among the Moors. It was only
natural that an age, so reeking with superstition
that it persecuted the man who declared that the
earth revolves around the sun, should brand as an
agent of the devil any one familiar with hypnotic
power. Through a feminine character in whom
were combined the best qualities of Mohammedanism
and the gift of healing, Sardou was able
to throw the strongest light upon superstition in the
Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
The plot of <i>La Sorcière</i> is the work of a master
craftsman. In motivation and in development of
situation the play is so well rounded that no part
can be removed without spoiling the whole. The
action opens with a humorous scene in which a petty
officer vested with authority is bullying a crowd
of peasants, among whom is supposed to be the
culprit who stole the corpse of an executed criminal
publicly exposed&mdash;the body being that of an unconverted
Moor who had loved a Christian girl. In
this scene Sardou begins to draw his background
of superstition by means of the words of the ignorant
natives, who jump at a suggestion of one of their
number, and denounce as the thief Zoraya, the
&ldquo;Sorceress.&rdquo; In a scene poetic with romance and
beauty Don Enrique and Zoraya, whom he wishes
to arrest, drift into the same relation which resulted
in the death of the young Moor, whose body
had been stolen. This act is the great corner-stone
of the drama. Sardou&rsquo;s skillful motivation prepares
the reader for developments in the coming four
acts, but this craftsmanship is so carefully hidden
that the relations of incidents are so natural that
they come in the form of surprises. The sequence
of the events is perfect. The transition from the
first to the second act, in which develop Don
Enrique&rsquo;s dangerous secret relationship with Zoraya
and his inexplicable reason for discontinuing his
visits to her, is perfectly natural, and the last scene
of the act, consisting of only a few phrases of explanation,
suddenly reveals such an astonishing complication
that the effect is nothing short of tremendous.
With a climax so effective the entire
foundation of the action is laid. We have learned
that the Christian girl whom Zoraya has begun to
cure with hypnotic power is to become the bride of
Don Enrique, a fact which she did not know before
the girl was taken away happy with the thought
that she should now be more acceptable to her
lover.
</p>

<p>
In the third act Don Enrique&rsquo;s character is tested
in a struggle which he loses with overpowering circumstances.
Gossips open the action with a frivolous
discussion of the marriage of Don Enrique and
the governor&rsquo;s daughter. They satisfactorily explain
that the parents of the couple years before had
arranged the marriage. They also gossip about
sorcerers and sorceresses. From suggestions we
learn that Zoraya is in danger, and that her relations
with Enrique are known. Close by the nuptial
chamber begins the clash of fateful circumstances,
which decide within a short time the destinies of
Don Enrique and Zoraya. Near the conclusion of
this act we have the purest essence of tragedy, if
we accept Aristotle&rsquo;s statement that tragedy is an
imitation of actions which are terrible and piteous.
Enrique, after nobly refusing to renounce his country
and his religion and to flee with Zoraya to
Morocco, is forced to become with her a fugitive
after he unintentionally kills an agent of the Inquisition
who suddenly detects them and attempts
to arrest Zoraya. Flight and pursuit of Don
Enrique and Zoraya close the act. This scene is one
of gripping intensity.
</p>

<p>
The merciless execution of power, the intolerance
and tyranny of the Holy Inquisition are portrayed in
an exemplification of a session of that body in the
fourth act. Again the action to be developed is
disclosed by the conversation of monks waiting for
the council to convene. We learn that Zoraya and
Don Enrique have been captured. We know the
penalty likely to be pronounced upon them, but
we remember that it is Zoraya alone who has the
power of restoring to consciousness the daughter of
the governor and bride of Enrique, who is deeply
sleeping on her nuptial night. The unrelenting
cruelty used by the Inquisition in making the captive
hag and the unfortunate young girl testify
against Zoraya, from whom they wring a confession
to sorcery in order to free Don Enrique, rouses
pity and indignation, which increase to highest pitch
when her lover, who stands at the side unobserved
by her until she has told all, is deceived into believing
that she is a sorceress and that he has been
victimized. But this has not been done without
bringing upon the members of the Inquisition
Zoraya&rsquo;s storm of righteous denunciation. There is
anguish unutterable when Don Enrique, who does
not know that Zoraya has made the greatest sacrifice
that a human being can make, accuses her of being
false. To this injustice is added the climax of the
act which closes with this awful sentence: &ldquo;We
shall burn her after vespers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The final act is short and intense. Zoraya has
been sentenced to death, but we know that she still
holds the possible price of her freedom. The final
setting of the play is magnificent: it is characteristic
of Sardou. Here is a street scene in front of a
great cathedral near which is a pyre ready for
burning Zoraya. Into this act are packed all of the
color, the pomp and the pageantry of the church and
chivalry of the heroic age in Spain. There is a
wonderful procession, a stirring mob scene, intensified
with the solemn sounds of religious chanting,
the roll of organ music and the resonant boom of
tower bells. Don Enrique learns of Zoraya&rsquo;s sacrifice.
As we expected, she is given her liberty on
condition that she restore to consciousness the governor&rsquo;s
daughter, a performance that causes the
mob, already incensed by fanatical monks, to demand
her death immediately after receiving the liberty
which she deserves. Don Enrique nobly
chooses death with her.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of the action shows Sardou&rsquo;s
wonderful technique at its best. The sequence of
events is natural and the transition from situation
to situation is motivated so realistically that the
threads of the structure cannot be detected. Wide
passages cross and recross until they become intricately
involved in mazes which ultimately lead
to the foot of an unscalable blind-arcade. Then
suddenly there come from an unexpected place a
glimmer of light, a swift opening of doors, and all is
seen at a flash. This is not ordinary stagecraft&mdash;it
is the necromancy of stagecraft!

The translator has endeavored to follow as closely
as possible <i>La Sorcière</i> as Sardou wrote it, remembering
that Browning said in the introduction to his
translation of the <i>Agememnon</i> of Æschylus: &ldquo;I
should require him [the translator] to be literal at
every cost save that of absolute violence of our
language.&rdquo;

of the scene, below, is the Tagus lying deep between
its banks, and the Bridge of San Martino. On the
heights beyond are the city, the Mirador and the

<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> (<i>Running to the right</i>) He arrives
opportunely. (<i>Addressing respectfully, hat in hand,</i>

esquire, Ramiro.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Behind the scene</i>) What are you
doing there?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Making arrests, my lord. And, may
I venture to pray Your Honor to dismount and
climb up this rough path? We have warrants
which are very important.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Outside</i>) Very good!&mdash;I will
come. (<i>Murmurs of satisfaction from the captives.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Here is our general, Don Enrique Palacios,
commander of the archers and cross-bowmen
of the city. He will examine you on the spot.

Scene Two
</h3>

<p class="sdintro_c">
Those in the preceding scene, <span class="sc">Enrique</span>, two
valets of the hunt
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Looking at the captives</i>) Oh, ho!
This is a fine catch with one stroke of the hand!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> I was going to conduct these people to
Toledo to be examined. Your Honor may spare
me the pain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Peasants.</span> (<i>All speaking at the same time</i>)
Mercy, Excellency!&mdash;Pity!&mdash;Pity!&mdash;We are innocent!&mdash;We
did not do it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> (<i>Exasperated</i>) Peace! Keep quiet,
there, brawlers! Do not bewilder his lordship with
your croakings!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Be considerate, Ramiro. They have
the right to speak in their own defence. (<i>He is assisted
in stepping upon a piece of rock at the right
of the scene. He seats himself on a boulder after
giving his cross-bow to</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span>.) What has caused
this disturbance?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Your lordship has not forgotten a
young Moorish armourer employed on his estate,
named Kalem?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Kalem? Yes! a clever artisan and
also a handsome lad, who worked for me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Unfortunately one of those black, obstinate
rebels, who will not admit since the conquest
of Granada by our glorious sire (<i>he uncovers
his head and bows</i>) that the dominion of the Moors
and the cult of their great devil Mohammed have
ended in Spain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes. Whenever I urged Kalem to
become converted he always refused.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> He went from bad to worse&mdash;defying
a royal edict, which forbids all intimacy between an
unconverted Moor and a Christian, he betrayed the
daughter of a neighbor, a good Catholic. For that
offence the two culprits, in conformance with the
law, have been punished during your lordship&rsquo;s absence:
the girl thrown into solitude for life in the
convent of Mercy!&mdash;and Kalem, stoned to death!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah! the poor boy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Yesterday at sunset, up there at the
foot of an elm!&mdash;After which I left the body fastened
to the tree-trunk, according to custom, to
serve as a warning to these accursed heathen. But,
no! They are enraged! The body has disappeared!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> When was it removed?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Last night.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> By whom?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> I do not know. The news was slow in
coming and I was ordered to go out during the night
and surprise the residents of this vicinity in their
beds and bring them to an inquest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And the result?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> Nothing!&mdash;They have nothing to say!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Peasants.</span> (<i>All together</i>) We know
nothing, your lordship, nothing! So truly as there
is a God, we are innocent. (<span class="sc">Arias</span> <i>hushes them
with a gesture.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Is there among them a relative or
friend of Kalem?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> Not one, your lordship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">A Peasant.</span> None, my lord!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> No one who would have a reason
for stealing his body?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> (<i>All at the same time</i>) Not one, my
lord!&mdash;Far from here!&mdash;A dog of a Mussulman!&mdash;We
are good Christians!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">A Woman.</span> We should have stoned him to death
a second time! (<i>They hear voices outside, at left.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Keep quiet, there!&mdash;Listen!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> (<i>Looking</i>) Here is something more to
please us.

The same, the goatherd, an archer. They enter at left

Answer, villain, Don Enrique Palacios!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> It is you, then, who stole the body?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> Me! my Sweet Deliverer!&mdash;touch
a corpse!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Then why did you run?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> (<i>Lowering his voice</i>) For
not speaking&mdash;and for fear she would revenge herself
upon me for exposing her!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And who&mdash;is she?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> (<i>Looking nervously about</i>)
She who took the body.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> A woman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> (<i>Half aloud</i>) The Moorish
woman!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Others.</span> (<i>Seconding him</i>) The Sorceress!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;It
was she!&mdash;It was she!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> The Sorceress?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> Certainly, my lord. I have
often seen her at night wandering on the heights
and making conjurations to the moon, so I was not
surprised to see her up there at daybreak this morning
making curious gestures, in this way&mdash;I hurried
my flock to avoid her&mdash;when two nigger devils approached
her along that path! I was seized with a
foolish fancy to know what these three were charming,
and I clambered and crawled over the rocks
toward them. But she pricked up her ears, the
magician, and scrutinized the slope where I was
lying with such a terrible gaze that I rolled down
and scampered away, saying to myself: &ldquo;I hope that
her eyes have not changed me into a brown owl,
or into a bad beast!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Then she is the guilty one?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Peasants.</span> (<i>Eagerly</i>) It is she, your lordship;
it is the Sorceress, without a doubt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And who among you believe she is
a sorceress?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Peasants.</span> Oh, all!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">First Man.</span> It is believed everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">A Woman.</span> She has caused enough misfortune
with her deviltries!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Second Man.</span> It has been proved that words
from her will give rot to the sheep.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">A Peasant.</span> And sickness to men. (<i>Murmurs
of approbation.</i>)
</p>

<p>

wife of Zuniga, a wet-nurse, whose milk supply she
caused to go dry.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">First Man.</span> And to José Barilla on whose barn
she caused lightning to descend.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Woman.</span> Oh! the wicked she-goat!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Another Woman.</span> She is the plague of this

<p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> Yes! Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Farez</span>, <i>who shrugs his

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> (<i>Coldly</i>) Me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> Yes. You who act so cunningly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Woman.</span> Yes. He laughs at all we say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> At all of your stupidities! (<i>All protest</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Come forward. Pay no attention to
them. What is your name?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Farez.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> A Moor?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Goatherd.</span> (<i>Maliciously</i>) But converted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> What is your trade?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Muleteer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Then, according to your opinion, these
people are wrong?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> This is all idle talk, my lord&mdash;the ravings
of old women. (<i>Cries from the peasants, whom</i>
<span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>silences.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Do you know this Moorish woman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Zoraya?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Is her name Zoraya?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Yes, my lord; that is to say, in the Arabic
tongue, &ldquo;The Star of the Morning.&rdquo; I have
long known her. I was in Granada before the conquest,
employed as a servant by her father, Abou-Abassa,
a scholar and physician of the last King
Boabdil.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Maiden, woman or widow&mdash;this Zoraya?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Widow, my lord!&mdash;Sometime before the
siege she was married to a very valiant Moor, who
was killed in a sortie.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Being now a Granadan, does she reside
in Toledo?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> After the capture of Toledo, the wise
Bishop Talavera, Governor of our city, took a
strong fancy to Abou-Abassa because of his great
knowledge and made him come here to reside. The
daughter, of course, lived with him. The mother
is no longer of this earth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Does she reside in Toledo?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> No, my lord; but near here on this
mountain-slope in a house built by her father, who
died in the past year. She lives there alone with
her old servants and her few surviving friends. Her
door is always open to those of her race and her
religion who appeal to her in need or in sickness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah! She likewise practises healing?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> Free of charge! Her father left her
great wealth and the knowledge of his art. Those
of her own race are not the only ones who have
sought her aid. (<i>Addressing the peasants</i>) More
than one Christian who has secretly begged gold and
medicines from her now shows his ingratitude by
accusing her of causing hail to fall upon the fields.
(<i>The peasants protest.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Silencing them</i>) That is enough!
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>) Keep the muleteer. Release the
others. (<i>Exclamations of joy.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">The Peasants.</span> Ah, thanks! your lordship!
God will reward you! Long live His Excellency!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> (<i>Pushing them along</i>) Go! Go! Disperse
without noise! (<i>They leave from both sides
of the scene.</i>)

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Farez</span>, <i>rising</i>) You say that
she resides near here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> (<i>Pointing to the left, below</i>) On this
hillside&mdash;a white house, half way up the slope, with
beautiful gardens and a terrace mirrored in the waters
of the Tagus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> You may conduct me there. (<i>To the
archers and valets</i>) Go! (<i>They go out.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> If Your Grace will follow me&mdash;But
she is not far&mdash;There she is!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> The Moorish woman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Farez.</span> It is she herself&mdash;I see her coming up
the slope.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Farez</span>) You may return
home. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span>) You, here, step
to one side and keep quiet. And observe her practicing
her black art.
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<span class="sc">Farez</span> <i>disappears at right,</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span>
<i>going to the left, where, screened by rocks
and bushes from</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya&rsquo;s</span> <i>view, they watch
her.</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>appears near the gap, coming
slowly up the path into the clear moonlight
as she reaches the summit. She carries a silver
sickle in her hand; on her arm a sheaf
of wild flowers. She descends the pathway
slowly, gathering flowers as she passes.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>behind him</i>) That is
a strange task!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> (<i>Behind</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>, <i>rising to
see</i>) See, my lord, in her hand?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>In a low voice</i>) That silver sickle?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> Which shines like the crescent moon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> The crescent of Mohammed&mdash;the moon
is a Saracen and a sorceress!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Speak lower!&mdash;What curious harvest
brings her into the midst of these rocks?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> She is gathering bad herbs for her
philters and poisons.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> A beautiful creature, truly. See the
grace and suppleness in her movements.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> One might say as much of a serpent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> For shame!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Your Honor should be careful or this
she-devil may throw over him the same charm that
Circe of yore threw over Ulysses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Joking</i>) Am I like the goatherd
to believe that she will change me into a beast?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> No! But through love&mdash;it is the
same!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Enough!&mdash;I must speak
to her! (<i>He advances into the full moonlight.</i>)
Zoraya!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Who is calling me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I, Enrique Palacios, commander of
the archers of the city.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> What does his lordship desire?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> The truth!&mdash;It was you and two accomplices
who took down and carried away Kalem&rsquo;s
body?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> It was, my lord.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> For use in some conjurations&mdash;for
you are a magician, it appears?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> So it is said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> By those who hate me because I am
Moorish and faithful to the law of the Koran.
(<i>Murmurs from</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Peace, there. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span>) So you
have not come here to work some magic in the moonlight,
or to meet an accomplice in your sorceries?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I come to gather herbs in the night and
to be alone; and in moonlight because it is easier to
recognize them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> What do you do with them?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> From the hearts of these flowers, my
lord, I extract essences and perfumes for myself and
ointments, elixirs and powders for curing diseases.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Are these remedies, these poisonous
herbs?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes; wholesome and healing. The vermilion
fruit of the black henbane and that of the
deadly nightshade or belladonna cure delirium and
insanity. They also put sufferers to sleep. Also these
others. They are like all things of the world, in love
the same: according to the case and the dose, cure
or kill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Oh! by that I understand that you
deal in love philters.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> What need of them, my dear lord?&mdash;Love
is born of a smile, rather than of a philter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Jesting</i>) Do you often make that
test?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Never!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>The same</i>) Oh!&mdash;so chaste&mdash;in
spite of those eyes, there?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Through pride! It is not necessary to
search for dignity in me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Bless me! the beautiful! You are
very difficult.&mdash;But let that pass!&mdash;If it were not
for some evil work why did you steal Kalem&rsquo;s body?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> The human flesh is not made to feed
ravens and wolves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> You have buried it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> In a crevice in the rocks&mdash;you may assure
yourself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> A criminal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> To me he was not a criminal, whose
only crime was to have loved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> A Christian!&mdash;in spite of the law
which forbids love between your race and mine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> It is love, however, which will reconcile
them in the long run.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah, well! to justify that you shall
explain to His Eminence the Cardinal Ximénès.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Frightened</i>) The Inquisitor!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> It is to him that I must take you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>The same</i>) Oh, no, my dear lord!
No! You must not say that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Why not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> You know that the high priest detests
us and persecutes us. You do not want to injure
me; for you are good&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> How do you know that?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Oh, I see it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> In truth, what indications do you
see?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Those which my father revealed to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Of the nature of men?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And their destinies.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Do you read this in the stars?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> My knowledge does not come from
them.&mdash;But through the crystal, the mirror, the silver
disc and the lines of the hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah! By God!&mdash;I am curious to see
what you read in mine!&mdash;Come here!
</p>

<p>
(<i>He seats himself on a large stone at the foot of
the path,</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>goes down to him after putting
down her bouquet of flowers and plants.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> (<i>Low to</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span> <i>during this part of the
scene</i>) Ah! the bewitcher!&mdash;See how she takes him
little by little into her coils in order to escape punishment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Stands near</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span>, <i>who holds out
his left hand for her inspection</i>) You are loyal, my
lord, and brave&mdash;but your will is feeble and unsteady.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Where do you see that?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> In the shape of your head and the first
phalange of your thumb, which is short&mdash;I see here
that you are subject to sudden and terrible bursts
of anger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Smiling</i>) It is true! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>,
<i>without turning round</i>) Is it not, Ramiro?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> (<i>Grumbling in a low voice</i>) Rain of
Heaven! Why has he not strangled this accursed
woman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>In the same vein</i>) The life-line, beautiful
at the beginning&mdash;stops short&mdash;danger of death&mdash;struck
as with lightning!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Gaily</i>) A soldier&rsquo;s death&mdash;so much
the better! Seat yourself; you will be more at ease.
(<i>He makes room for her to sit on the stone.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Seating herself, continues in the same
vein</i>) These wrinkles which cross at the base of the
thumb show an inclination very&mdash;very amorous!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Oh! as to that&mdash;Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> This deep red line, which connects the
thumb with the life-line&mdash;a passion! Oh!&mdash;that!
Like she who possesses you!&mdash;It will end only with
your life!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Then it is to be returned?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I do not know&mdash;why should one be
troubled about that?
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<i>While looking at his hand,</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>leans more
and more against</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span>, <i>who is intoxicated
by the nearness of their persons, by the
Arabian perfume on her hair and by the
warmth of her hand.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Rising in order to lean over</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya&rsquo;s</span>
<i>neck</i>) What flower have you robbed of this
perfume?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> The golden cassie!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> It is exquisite!&mdash;You who read the
future so well in the hand&mdash;(<i>She attempts to withdraw
her hand</i>) No! No! Do not take away your
hand!&mdash;do you also know how to read the present
in my thoughts? (<i>He turns</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya&rsquo;s</span> <i>face gently
towards his own.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Returning his ardent gaze</i>) Yes! (<i>In
a low voice</i>) You think that I am beautiful and desirable!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>The same</i>) But I am a Saracen, a pagan,
an outcast! I am one whom you have not the
right to love!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Therefore, you are more desirable!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>The same</i>) Don&rsquo;t you find the royal
edict which would punish us very severe: I thrown
into the oubliette&mdash;you sent to the galleys or to the
stake?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Too severe&mdash;certainly!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Wasn&rsquo;t Kalem excusable for risking
such a cruel fate?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And doesn&rsquo;t she, this unfortunate girl
who had not the strength to resist the madness of a
similar love, deserve pity?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> The Christian girl!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! I understand why she forgot that
she was a Spaniard and a Catholic and became only
a woman, simply a woman!&mdash;O Nature! the victory
was thine!&mdash;I envy her for having been given a
body to be loved and adored without fear of the torture
which menaces this world&mdash;and the damnation
promised in the next!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> You could be so brave as she?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Ah! certainly, yes!&mdash;who
could be braver than she!&mdash;Can your race produce a
Kalem? If so, he is worthy of me! I promise hours
of beauty and rapture to him who does not fear
the executioner and who will brave the flames at
the stake for that which the sun of Africa has set
burning in my veins!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Taking her in his arms</i>) I shall be
that man! (<i>She pushes him gently away. He recovers
his presence of mind and quickly withdraws</i>)
Ah! demon! You have intoxicated me! Go away
from me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Adieu, then, my dear lord.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Turning</i>) Adieu!&mdash;Yes, adieu!&mdash;It
is better so! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Arias</span>) Let that
woman go! (<i>Picking up her flowers, she slowly
reascends the slope</i>) What creature is that!&mdash;her
hand burned in mine and her gaze set my brain
awhirl!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> I have a remedy, my lord! Say a pater
quickly and repeat an ave twice to break the
charm!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Arias.</span> (<i>Preparing to shoot an arrow from his
cross-bow at</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span>) I have a better one!&mdash;Kill
the beast, kill&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Seizing his arm</i>) Ah! brute!&mdash;Stop!
(<i>He passes the cross-bow to</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>, <i>then crosses
the scene to the right to</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span>, <i>who has returned

<h2>
ACT TWO
</h2>

<p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Moorish chamber with three arches.
Beyond is seen a garden similar to that of the Generalife
of Granada, with a fountain and a narrow canal
bordered with trimmed yew trees and pots of
red sandstone containing flowers. The arch at the
right gives access to a terrace beyond which Toledo
rises in the distance beneath a burning sunlight. At
the right of the arcade is the entrance to</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya&rsquo;s</span>
<i>sleeping chamber. On the same side is a small door.
In contrast with the spreading blue of the heavens
and the great heat on the fields and garden, the room
conveys an impression of coolness. On the floor are
tiles laid in mosaic. In the center of the scene is
an elaborate fountain basin surrounded with cushions.
On the ceiling are beams and panels of cedar.
To a height of about six feet, an ivory-colored border
surmounted with a blue earthenware moulding
extends about the room. The three arches are closed
at will with heavy and rich portières. To the right
is a little low table inlaid with ivory and nacre.
There are several cushions on it. Against the wall
stands an Arabian coffer. Here and there are large
Moresque vases containing palms and bouquets of
flowers. It is morning. There are sounds of distant
bells, which shortly cease to ring.</i>

<p class="sdintro_p3">
<span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>draws open the curtains in the right
arch.</i> <span class="sc">Zaguir</span> <i>appears at the foot in the
garden and cautiously calls</i> <span class="sc">Aisha</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> My aunt!&mdash;My aunt!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>In an undertone, turning</i>) What?&mdash;Who?&mdash;Who
is calling me out there?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> (<i>In the same voice</i>) I have something
important to tell you while the mistress is still here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Something serious?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Then come in and speak quickly. (<span class="sc">Zaguir</span>
<i>goes toward her</i>) What is it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Here!&mdash;last night at sunset, I saw sitting
and conversing near the path which leads down
toward the bridge of San Martino, perhaps a hundred
paces or more from this house, two men who
were not mere passers-by, or residents of this neighborhood.
When the sun rose this morning they were
still there, lying behind some fig trees, as if they had
passed the night in watching.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>Disturbed</i>) The same!&mdash;you are positive?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Positive!&mdash;They are still there. You
can see them. (<i>They cautiously go to the terrace
at right</i>) Stop! they are standing at present.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> There are three of them!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Yes!&mdash;the one with the grizzled beard
was not there. He has just arrived.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Be careful in returning. (<i>She returns
to the center of the scene.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> (<i>The same</i>) As they have been there
since last evening, it must be that they are lying in
wait for some one.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> And whom?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> (<i>With embarrassment</i>) Perhaps those
who come at night and return at dawn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>Severely</i>) What did you say?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Don&rsquo;t be angry&mdash;I am only
warning you! Otherwise, I should have said nothing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> And what do you know, naughty boy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Only the worst of things. For example,
that he comes down the slope and enters through
the orchard gate, which has a key; that he steals
along in the shadow of the arcades until he reaches
here and that he goes away in a similar manner&mdash;on
foot as he comes, without entrusting to us his
horse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Above all you have not mentioned this?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Indeed to no person!&mdash;it is serious!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> He is a Moor, a refugee in the Sierra,
a rebel who comes secretly to obtain medicine for
his wife who is ill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Poor woman!&mdash;to consume all the remedies
which he has obtained every night during two
months!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> You presumptuous boy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Do not call me after all kinds of beasts,
auntie dear! I don&rsquo;t ask you who this unknown is;
he concerns me not. But I know truly that I
should be cut in pieces before I would whisper a
word. You may tell your mistress that!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Allah protect me! I shall not tell her
that you know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> As you wish! But whisper to her that
they are watching her house. (<i>The bells again begin
to ring.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> And in vain for two days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Yes, fortunately!&mdash;He did not come
last night, or the night before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> And Zoraya is worried enough!&mdash;Go,
thou!&mdash;Quickly!&mdash;I hear her!

Ah! They are going away&mdash;do you see them?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes!&mdash;They are going down to the
bridge. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Zaguir</span>) Follow them!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> As far as the city?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> All about the city&mdash;and see where they
stop.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zaguir.</span> Yes, mistress!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Go! Go!

<h3>
Scene Three
</h3>

<p class="sdintro_c">
<span class="sc">Zoraya</span>, <span class="sc">Aisha</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>At the window, constantly looking
out</i>) Why are those bells ringing on this beautiful
morning?&mdash;Is there some Christian festival today?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> I know of none.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Reëntering the scene</i>) After waiting
for him all night I finally fell asleep. They awakened
me and I heard your voice. I believed he was
there, and I nearly betrayed myself by calling his
name in the boy&rsquo;s presence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> We must continue hoping that Don Enrique
will come tonight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Two nights without seeing him!&mdash;And
no word from him&mdash;what torture! And those bad
dreams! Give me the spotted cards.
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>brings a pack of cards which she lays
out on the little table. The sound of the
bells gradually dies out.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> He has probably been warned of the
presence of those men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Last night, yes&mdash;But the night before&mdash;did
Zaguir see them then?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> No.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Constantly occupied in arranging the
cards</i>) Then it was something else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Perhaps some sudden duty?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Doubtful! He is free! He has no
father, no mother, no wife, no children!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> He commands the archers, the blunderbuss
men and the cross-bowmen of the city. He
may be detained by the service.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> For two days?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> He is a member of the Council of Castile,
which may have been summoned to Aranjuez
where the king is sojourning.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes, possibly that is so!&mdash;Ah! if only
we had some means of secretly writing to each other!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Allah protect us! That would be a
quicker way of losing ourselves!&mdash;we are threatened
often enough, now!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! (<i>She raises a card.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> What?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> The Cavalier of the Sword&mdash;now I am
beginning to detect the cause!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> You see!&mdash;I thought until this minute
that we should not be left long in security! You
had decided to do as the others advised and flee
to the coast of Africa to escape the persecutions of
the Nazarenes! Then, it was necessary to meet
this man! Ah! misery upon us! Ever since the
time when he unexpectedly appeared while we were
breathing the evening breeze on the hill and when
you so foolishly threw yourself into his arms, I have
believed that I hear the black wings of Azrael, the
angel of death, brushing the roof of our house!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> &ldquo;Our Destiny,&rdquo; says the Prophet, &ldquo;is
suspended from our necks&rdquo;&mdash;If it is written that I
shall die for Enrique, then I may likewise wish that
it should be in his arms!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Oh! my daughter, you who were so
chaste in your widowhood, why are you enamored
with this infidel, this enemy of the true God?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Do you know how and why I love
him? I was at his mercy! A word, and he could
have thrown me into the dungeons of the Inquisition.
It was good of him to save my honor, a price which
they always extort from our other women. I will
risk anything for him. Those men were there to
act as my safeguards during the night. I shall wait
for an opportune time and flee to Toledo before
evening!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Rain of Heaven!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> But what weakness is ours! He is
young, he is generous in his love, his gaze is tender!&mdash;when
he liberated me, I could dream no more of
fleeing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Alas!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Returning to the cards</i>) Ah! &ldquo;The
King!&rdquo;&mdash;A powerful enemy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> You see! You see!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Sh&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> What?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I believe I hear him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> No!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Besides, he would not come before
night!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Ah! I hope he will not come this evening&mdash;and
never again!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Silence! You wretch! Do you want
me to die of sorrow?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> That would be better than being buried
alive in an oubliette as poor Kalem&rsquo;s accomplice and
for a crime similar to his!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I should die first!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Allah! Allah! listen to her&mdash;Where is
there a love that has made any one reasonable! All
these nights I have been there, I, cowering on my
couch waiting and listening and trembling at the
least noise. And you can be happy&mdash;you&mdash;with such
a menace hanging over you!&mdash;What folly!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Rising and putting away the cards</i>)
You do not understand anything, poor Aisha! To
love without peril is beautiful&mdash;it is the common
kind of love. But the kind that is outlawed, accursed
and condemned at its beginning&mdash;the love
that braves all perils, that defies death, that brings
the bitter-sweet of forbidden kisses and maddening
embraces during which it is said, &ldquo;This may be the
last!&rdquo;&mdash;that is love!&mdash;that is love!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>Groaning</i>) Ah!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Be silent! This time it is his step.
(<i>She runs to the door at the left and opens it</i>) It is
he!&mdash;Ah! it is he!&mdash;It is he!
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>appears on the threshold of the little
door.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Finally&mdash;Ah! God!&mdash;At last! at last!
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>as she passes</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>to fasten the little
door</i>) Watch carefully. (<i>After fastening the
draperies,</i> <span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>goes into the garden.</i>)

<h3>
Scene Four
</h3>

<p class="sdintro_c">
<span class="sc">Zoraya</span>, <span class="sc">Enrique</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span>) Your heart beats!&mdash;You
have been running?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> They have pursued you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Removing his mantle</i>) No!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And on the road, did you see no one?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Not one person! (<i>He places on the
stool his mantle, his hat and his sword.</i>) I did not
come by way of the bridge, but by the path up the
hillside after crossing the river in a boat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Seated on the cushions</i>) In daylight!
What imprudence! And instead of coming last
night when I waited so anxiously for you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I, too, have had occasion to think of
that!&mdash;When I left you at dawn the day before yesterday
I saw standing at the end of the bridge a man
whom I knew had no ordinary reason for being
there at that hour. I passed him quickly, covering
myself closely with my cloak. He followed me, but
I reached my residence after throwing him off my
trail in an alley.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> He followed you?&mdash;You are certain?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Absolutely certain. It was to baffle
him that I forced myself to remain away from you
last night and the night before and that I crossed
the river in a boat, below the Mirador.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes! (<i>Rising</i>) Oh! it is clear now! It
is well for you that they watched only at night.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And why?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> The men watched there behind those
fig trees. (<i>He goes toward the terrace.</i>) No!&mdash;they
have gone away, thinking it useless to watch for
you in the daytime.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> How many?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Three. One of them seemed to be the
chief.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Did he have a small, grizzly beard?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Eagerly</i>) It was he who spied upon
me. I believe I recognize him! (<i>Seats himself
at right on the fountain basin.</i>) It is Cardenos, one
of my father&rsquo;s old soldiers, but now an agent of the
Holy Office and a religious bigot!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>At his right, standing</i>) Then! he
has recognized you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I doubt it. He would hardly wait
one day. He knows only that you are receiving some
unknown person in the night. If I were suspected
they would prowl round my house and I have seen
nothing of them&mdash;At least, whatever there is in this,
we must be on guard.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Oh, yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And for the sake of prudence give up
seeing each other.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> For several days&mdash;surely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Say&mdash;some weeks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Protesting</i>) Several weeks?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> It is the only way to stop them from
spying upon us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Several weeks!&mdash;without seeing each
other?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> My Zoraya, you must resign yourself
to it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Resign myself!&mdash;Oh, resignation is easy
for you! Our love is not the only affair of your life!&mdash;But
I!&mdash;I cannot conquer my loneliness after you
depart with the thought that you will return when
the first star flowers in the heavens. I shall no
more, during the great heat of the day, dream of
the night&rsquo;s divine joys, which live again in thoughts
of you. I shall feel lonely enough in this house
during the coolness of evening when alone I shall
hear the soft wind in the branches, the songs of my
birds, the purling of my streams&mdash;then all that
charms me at other times will bring in your absence
only sorrow and tears!&mdash;Those two nights without
you, how long they seemed!&mdash;and you speak of
weeks!&mdash;several weeks, you say. &ldquo;Where is he?
What is he doing? Does he think of me? If he
should never return!&rdquo; (<span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>makes a quick
movement.</i>) Ah! perhaps that is what you wish to
say and dare not tell me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> If you fear those men?&mdash;If you wish to
see me no more?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Protesting</i>) You believe me cowardly!&mdash;When
I have risked myself in plain day to see
you for an instant!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> That is true!&mdash;But you seem so preoccupied,
so troubled&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Like yourself&mdash;by this danger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes, but I am more tender than you&mdash;While
you&mdash;they say that your heart is always far
away&mdash;far away from me!&mdash;Look at me!&mdash;I want
you to look at me!&mdash;Quickly!&mdash;without taking time
to invent a lie! (<i>She turns</i> <span class="sc">Enrique&rsquo;s</span> <i>face toward
her.</i>) Your gaze seems to tell me that your love
has been stolen from me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah! My charmer! What a long
time until then!&mdash;Since the hour when we first met,
they have followed me everywhere, those eyes, there&mdash;they
call to me day and night!&mdash;Ramiro had said
to me, &ldquo;Take care, my lord, that the magician does
not throw over you some kind of a love charm!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ramiro is a silly fellow. There has
been neither a magician nor magic. &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; said my
father, &ldquo;is a combat, where, like flights of arrows,
contrary minds strive among themselves for a victory,
which finally rests with the fallen.&rdquo; I desired
ardently to be loved by you. You did not know
how to defend yourself. I have shot my arrow into
your heart&mdash;in that lies all of my sorcery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And why did you so fervently desire
me to love you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Passing</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span>, <i>to the left</i>) First,
because of cowardice, my dear lord!&mdash;to extort from
you my pardon&mdash;and later on, if I conquered you, to
flee from Toledo!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ingrate!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Sitting</i>) It is bold of me to tell you
now&mdash;and next&mdash;for bravado, malice and revenge!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Revenge?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes, yes, revenge! I wanted to have
the pleasure of humiliating in you the Spaniard, the
Christian, the conqueror of my people, the enemy of
my race, which you declare impure! I wanted to
make you renounce your faith like the heroes of
that book of love (<i>she points to the book on the
table</i>), &ldquo;Celastine,&rdquo; which you have given me to
read&mdash;like Calixte, who said to his dear Melibee:
&ldquo;I am no more Christian or pagan. I am Melibee!
I believe in no one but Melibee, I adore no one but
Melibee!&rdquo; And, after all!&mdash;after all!&mdash;I wanted
to be loved&mdash;for the sake of love! Leaning against
you, nearly in your arms, as I am now, with your
cheek brushing my cheek&mdash;I felt little by little the
chaste coldness of my widowhood, which Aisha always
glorified, melting like snow in the glowing
warmth of our clasped hands, in the burning breath
from our hot lips&mdash;This fever of love which I believe
will never be cured has crept stealthily into
my blood. I am like one intoxicated. And when
you say to me: &ldquo;Go away, you are free!&rdquo; I shall
take with me in leaving the hope, the dear hope,
that you will come to me very soon on some dark
night and demand a ransom for my freedom. Ah!
my adored conqueror, you are well avenged! She
who would rule is no more than an humble slave
at your feet, subdued and tender as a tamed gazelle!
(<i>Sounds of the distant bells.</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>starts.</i>
<span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>does not move.</i>) What disturbs you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Those bells!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Well, they are ringing. What is that
to us?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> It means that they are calling me
and that it is time for us to part.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) So soon? What for? You
may remain here until the hour of the siesta when
the streets are deserted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Oh, no! That is impossible! (<i>He
rises.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Impossible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> There is to be a great feast in the
palace and a great ceremony in the cathedral. All
of my men are under arms and I must be at their
head. I have scarcely time to return to the city in
the same way that I came.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> By boat?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes. (<i>He takes up his hat, mantle
and sword.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And if they should watch for you on
the other side of the river?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Do not dream of that!&mdash;Fear nothing!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Oh! I fear everything just now, those
men&mdash;and for you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> For me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes! Yes! For either of us, who
knows? Last night I had a menacing dream! You
entered by that door! I ran to you! You were
nothing but a shadow, a vapor which dissolved in
my arms!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> What folly!&mdash;A dream!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> All dreams are not lies! If this one
should be true, what then?&mdash;Do assure me that you
are not going away to forsake me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Oh!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> For another!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Hush! Hush!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I would kill you first!&mdash;No, no! Do
not believe that! Pardon me for saying that&mdash;I have
suffered so much during these last two days. And
such bad omens! When do we meet again?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> God knows when! So soon as we can
without danger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Oh, no!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Where then?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I shall advise you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>In his arms</i>) And how shall I know?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> That will be arranged!&mdash;And, until
I come, my dear love, believe nothing, do you hear!&mdash;nothing,
only in my love for you! (<i>The bells
begin to ring again.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! those bells which always take you
from my arms!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> I hope to see you soon!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Watch carefully during your return
to the city.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes, yes!

Scene Five
</h3>

<p class="sdintro_p3">
<span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>opens the curtains in the left arch. Seeing
that</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>is alone, she descends into
the scene.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> He is gone?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Going back to the right</i>) Yes, and let
us hope safely. He will not return until many days
have passed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> I have turned away the poor men who
came at their usual hour seeking aid from you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! I am in a fine state of mind to
console others!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> I have again given Al Mansour&rsquo;s wife
that black liquor which lessens her husband&rsquo;s sufferings.
I also gave a purse of gold to Farizade.
Poor Saada is here again. She is discouraged. Her
sister suffers more than ever from that malady.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Alas! And there is no remedy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> She begs you to have pity on this unfortunate
woman, who asks that death relieve her
and who implores you to send her a beverage which
will put her into a sweet and everlasting sleep.
(<i>The bells stop ringing.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! that is the right kind of charity.
They give that to a diseased dog, but they condemn
human beings whom they love to suffer useless tortures&mdash;it
is barbarous and stupid!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> Saada will return tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Prepare for her bitter almond essence
in a covering of pure wax the size of a muscat grain.
That will take away the poor girl in less time than
one can say: &ldquo;There is no other God but Allah!&rdquo;
If it is a crime to do this, I am ready to face the
charge. Is that all?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>With hesitation</i>) No!&mdash;there is another
whom I did not want to send away. It is an
urgent case, she said. She is anxiously waiting out
there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Do I know her?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> (<i>The same</i>) She is an old friend of your
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;Fatoum.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) That wretched woman who
was converted! I will not see her!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Aisha.</span> She assures me she has been faithful to
the Prophet&rsquo;s law.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> (<i>She goes to</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span>, <i>who is seated,

<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Severely</i>) Dare you pronounce His
sacred name, you who have renounced the God of
your fathers! Take care that He does not hear
you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> He reads my heart and sees that I
am converted only because I do not want to be separated
from the child, whom I have brought here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Your daughter?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> By birth, no, Zoraya; by affection,
ah! certainly, yes! She was ten years old when her
mother died, and I have reared her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> A Spaniard?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Yes! You alone can heal her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> That is a case for the Christian physicians.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> They know little or nothing. I have
come to you because your father&mdash;on him rested Allah&rsquo;s
benediction&mdash;was their master in everything
and taught you the secrets of his art.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Well, who is she?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> She consented to come only when I
promised not to reveal her name.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Then she may go!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Zoraya, have pity! This child&rsquo;s father
is a hardened Catholic!&mdash;If he knew that I
had taken his daughter to a Moor&rsquo;s home, I would
be cruelly punished! Out of fondness for me, she
keeps it a secret!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> She need not know that you have betrayed
it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> If you promise me&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes, I promise!&mdash;Who is she?

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Doña Joana, daughter of the Governor
of Toledo!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Quickly rising</i>) That madman who is
hunting our refugees in the Sierra and killing them
without pity!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Allah, the Most High, rewards the
faithful for their sufferings! This child is innocent
of her father&rsquo;s cruelties. She is charitable and
good, the same as we ourselves. Moreover, she is
very pious. She has been out of the convent only
four days and will be married today.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Ah! those bells!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Her marriage! In order to have her
visit you we have taken advantage of a journey to
the convent of Mercy on this beautiful morning to
ask the benediction of the abbess.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> The convent of Mercy!&mdash;In it is confined
the poor creature who loved Kalem, whom
they stoned to death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> I do not know.
</p>

<p>

The same persons and <span class="sc">Doña Joana</span>
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<span class="sc">Joana</span> <i>enters, timid, frightened and supported
in</i> <span class="sc">Fatoum&rsquo;s</span> <i>arms.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Kindly</i>) Do you not fear, señorita, to
come into a pagan&rsquo;s home?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> Fatoum has told me that you are charitable.
That is the law of the Gospel!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And also that of the Koran&mdash;In that
our religions are the same!&mdash;Seat yourself, my
daughter (<i>she sits upon the cushions at her side</i>)&mdash;and
tell me your trouble.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> (<i>Timidly</i>) Permit Fatoum to tell it instead
of me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> (<i>Seated on a stool which</i> <span class="sc">Aisha</span> <i>has
placed in the left of the scene</i>) It is very strange&mdash;She
rises in her sleep at night. Without seeing any
one, she goes, comes, attends to her ordinary duties
and returns to her bed&mdash;and during all that time
she is in a dream.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Taking</i> <span class="sc">Joana&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand, which relaxes</i>)
And she remembers nothing of it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> Oh, nothing!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> This also happened in the convent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> No, no! I prefer to have her tell me
about it, herself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> While in the convent I was frequently
seized at night by a desire which led me to walk
barefoot through the corridors to the chapel where
I lighted the altar candles, prayed and sang a canticle!&mdash;and
the next day the candles were still burning
and I would not believe that I had lighted them.
I prayed in vain to God to deliver me from this
infirmity. I decided to come to you this morning
with Fatoum, who says you are so wise!&mdash;For I am
to be married today. If my husband sees me get up
in the night and promenade like a phantom, he will
believe it is a punishment from Heaven!&mdash;He will
abhor me and I will die of shame!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Leaning towards her</i>) And during
the day when you pray you fall into a dream of
ecstasy, do you not&mdash;and you make believe that
you are no more on this earth?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> (<i>Feeling gradually the suggestions to
sleep</i>) Oh, yes&mdash;yes!&mdash;It is so beautiful! Ah, it is
delicious! I see Heaven!&mdash;blue&mdash;all blue, encircled
with a golden light!&mdash;I hear the songs of seraphim
and archangels!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> And is all beautiful in this delicious
slumber into which you are falling?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> (<i>Sleepily</i>) Yes!&mdash;Yes, beautiful!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> As this? (<i>She closes</i> <span class="sc">Joana&rsquo;s</span> <i>eyes.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> Yes!&mdash;I see&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> (<i>In a low voice</i>) Is she asleep?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> It is a sleep like that in which she
walks at night.

<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Joana!&mdash;Señorita!&mdash;My child!

she also speak of taking the veil?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Ah, God!&mdash;It is her only dream.
But she is her father&rsquo;s only child. He will not consent
to it and is obliging her to marry, which makes
her disconsolate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Does she object to the marriage, or to
the man who is to be her husband? (<i>Calling</i>)
Joana! (<span class="sc">Joana</span> <i>moves.</i> <span class="sc">Zoraya</span> <i>continues.</i>) Answer!&mdash;Do
you feel tenderly for him whom you are
to marry?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> (<i>Feebly</i>) I do not love him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Then, it is a feeling of aversion?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> No! (<i>Sadly</i>) I do not want to marry!&mdash;I
want to be a nun.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Do you hear that!&mdash;To me, to her
father, to the abbess and to the sisters at Mercy&mdash;she
has nothing to say but: &ldquo;I want to be a nun.&rdquo;
Do you think that they have encouraged her with
that idea in the convent and pictured marriage as
something frightful? She is afraid that she will
fall into one of those sleep-walking dreams tonight,
which would cause a scandal!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Perhaps marriage would cure this
malady.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Oh! I implore you, Zoraya, to heal
her yourself, at once&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> In a day, it is impossible!&mdash;Can you
not come later? I shall surely succeed in curing
her by frequently placing her in the present state in
which she thinks of nothing, feels nothing and moves
only at my command.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Is it possible?&mdash;It is magic!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> No!&mdash;It is one of the mysterious laws
of Nature that one will can fasten upon another, as
mine has upon this child&rsquo;s, and cause it to submit.
It is so, Fatoum, for good or bad. If my power over
this weaker creature were better established, and
not so recent, I could say to her at this moment:
&ldquo;On such a day, at such an hour, you shall sleep
this same sleep.&rdquo; And unless she guarded herself
while asleep, the least remembrance of that order on
the stated day and hour would cause her to sleep
unexpectedly in spite of her will, completely enslaved
by mine. It is time to awaken her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Not yet, I pray you!&mdash;Your will is so
powerful. Can you not give her some protection
against this disease tonight?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I can attempt it with great hope of
success.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> Oh! do it, Zoraya!&mdash;Do it! I shall
forever bless you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Joana! I tell you not to have the
least fear that your trouble will return tonight. I
have protected you. Do you understand?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> (<i>Feebly</i>) Yes!&mdash;Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Fatoum.</span> May Allah reward you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> I tell you to awaken.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> You are going to the convent of
Mercy?

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> Yes, to ask for the blessing of the Holy
Abbess.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> There is in that convent a Christian
maid, who, for having loved Kalem, is confined in
a dungeon where she never sees daylight, where she
awaits death to deliver her, if she has not yet answered
its call.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> Yes, poor girl, I know&mdash;but her
crime&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> You should quickly judge her as being
the least guilty.&mdash;Implore for that unfortunate
girl the mercy of the abbess, who will refuse you
nothing on this, your nuptial day&mdash;Ask that this
miserable creature be brought out of her living tomb,
that she be given a cell where she may see a ray of
sunlight, and that she be fed with other nourishment
than bread and water, which increase the sufferings
to which she is condemned. As for this today&mdash;Too
late, we fear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Joana.</span> I shall request this as a favor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> You swear that you will?

ACT THREE
</h2>

<p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Evening in a Spanish patio in the governor&rsquo;s
palace. It is seen obliquely. In the foreground
and on the three other sides a portico of columns
surrounds the central space which is open to the sky.
The court is ornamented with flowers and shrubs
and pomegranate, orange, myrtle and laurel trees
in red earthen pots. Seats of all kinds are scattered
about. At the foot, on the ground floor, is a large
chamber with a door in the middle and windows on
the sides. At the right, in the foreground, under
the portico, a small stairway of five carpeted steps
faces the audience and ends on a landing which
gives access to a vestibule and the bridal chamber,
where the outlines of dimly-lighted windows are
seen. The columns of the portico are decorated
with palms, foliage and flowers fastened with silk
ribbons. Roses and jasmines climb on the walls.
At the left, clearly in view, is a door opening on the
street, which is brightly lighted by the moon when
the door is open. The moon also shines intensely
bright on the front and right side of the house. The
rooms on the first floor have lighted windows. Lanterns
hang from the pillars of the portico. Hung
from a pillar at the left, a Madonna lamp lights the
front of the scene. There are doors at the right, the
left, the foot and at the extremities of the portico.</i>
</p>

<p><i>
Through the door and windows of the first floor
is seen the great dining chamber containing a table.
In the scene, cavaliers, women, bourgeoise and invited
guests of all kinds are seated everywhere; valets
are hurrying about passing basins of silver with
fruits, cake, etc. The señoras, seated, fan themselves,
chatter and gossip. There is a loud noise of
talk and laughter. Music is heard in the banquet
hall, interrupted with lively bursts of applause and
exclamations of joy. Little Spanish airs are played
sweetly on instruments like flutes, violins and hautebois.

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Rufina.</span> (<i>Seating herself in a chair
which</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>places at the left</i>) No!&mdash;I have just
arrived from Aranjuez, bringing the Queen&rsquo;s gift

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cristobol.</span> It was a beautiful ceremony, Señora.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Rioubos.</span> His Eminence Cardinal Ximénès himself

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Naturally! Doña Joana is his

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Yes, all day they have had on the

dancers and monstrous African monkeys!

<p>
<span class="spk">Don Ambrosio.</span> (<i>An old cavalier sitting in an

dancing in all the public places.

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Among us, this marriage was a
long time postponed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Fabia.</span> Yes&mdash;they were betrothed five
years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Pardon me, Señoras. When Don Enrique&rsquo;s
father&mdash;the Lord Palacios&mdash;felt that he could
not live much longer he decided to select a wife
for his son&rsquo;s future marriage. He and the Governor
made an arrangement whereby Don Enrique
and Doña Joana were affianced. As Doña Joana
was then only ten years old, her father made her
go to the convent to grow up!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Rufina.</span> They say she became so devout
they believed she would never come out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> She did not have a radiant air
in the church&mdash;the bride!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Rioubos.</span> No more than did Enrique.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cristobol.</span> There was one radiant person&mdash;the
Governor!

<p>
<span class="spk">Don Ambrosio.</span> Have they not yet taught these
rebels to be reasonable?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Velasco.</span> They have retreated into inaccessible
places where it is impossible to follow them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Don Ambrosio.</span> They are chasing these pagans
too long.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Not now, Don Ambrosio. His Eminence
and the Governor are after them with the
hand of death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Don Ambrosio.</span> Then, Ramiro, you will see the
advantages of severe treatment. Within six months
thousands of Moors will be converted.

<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> That is a mere farce, my Lord Ambrosio!
(<i>Gravely</i>) These new Christians are liars&mdash;they
go to mass, only to laugh when they come
away. They themselves confess of avowing only to
silly things. When their children are baptized, they
wash them quickly to cleanse them of what they call
the pollution of the blessed holy oil. (<i>Murmurs of
indignation</i>) Their daughters are married at our
altars, dressed as Christians, but when they reënter
their homes they dress themselves as Moors&mdash;and
celebrate their nuptials with dances and forbidden
Arabian songs, such as the zambra, to the music of
tambourines, trumpet-shells, cymbals and other instruments
also forbidden!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Rufina.</span> For my part, I can overlook the
zambra and the tambourine, but I strongly approve
prohibiting Moorish women from dyeing their eyebrows
and eyelashes. They are bold enough looking
without that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Oh, my! I think the most admirable
royal edict is the one which provides the penalty
of execution for any intimacy between a Spaniard
and a Mooress&mdash;for there are truly beautiful
girls in the homes of these Africans, and you are
not too little inclined, my lords, to perceive them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Rioubos.</span> And for my part, Señora, I strongly
approve of the edict which punishes with solitary
confinement in a dungeon any Spanish woman who
loves one of these blacks to whose beauty you are
not always indifferent.

Master Cleofas, I should like to say two words to
you in that regard.

<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> At Your Grace&rsquo;s disposition!
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> A physician!&mdash;said to be a charlatan,
who resided on the left bank of the river in a
house on the hillside, where his daughter now lives.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> Zoraya!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Oh, yes! I knew him!&mdash;I was enraged
to see Bishop Talavera honor and protect a
Moor, who had, they say, healed a sprain with
friction&mdash;in reality, Cardenos, by means of mystic
signs and magic incantations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> Then you are sure that man
was&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> A necromancer! And worse than
that! Listen and judge, friend Cardenos! (<i>He
seats himself</i>) One day I was riding my mule on
the road leading to the bridge of San Martino.
They called to me to examine a child which had
been taken from the river apparently dead. &ldquo;Have
you,&rdquo; I asked, dismounting, &ldquo;suspended it by the
feet in order to expel the water from the body?
&lsquo;Yes, lord&rsquo;&mdash;And that has not resulted in resuscitation?&mdash;&lsquo;No,
lord&rsquo;&mdash;Then, there is nothing more to
do. Good evening!&rdquo;&mdash;And I passed on&mdash;The
child was dead, was it not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos and the Young Men.</span> Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Eight days later I re-passed the
same place and whom do you think I saw playing on
the rocks with a gang of ragamuffins?&mdash;Who?&mdash;My
drowned child!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> Oh!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Astounded, I questioned the child
and found that after I left they had recourse to that
quack, Abou-Abassa, who had breathed in the
child&rsquo;s mouth, made strange motions with its arms
and succeeded in reanimating him after an hour and
one half!&mdash;The magic was shown in the breathing
and gestures and in this diabolical resurrection,
which was an ignoble parody on the miracles in
the Scriptures!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> It is the same evidence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> The wretch is dead!&mdash;But, his daughter,
who has been devoted to the works of the devil
since her birth, interferes just as he did with the
treatment of my patients: even with my own governor,
Pétronille, whom I attended after fainting
spells. I gave him hartshorn, which, you know, is
the best cure for such illnesses, as is also the oil
of ants and the salt of wood-lice&mdash;what is it they
call this Olivera&mdash;whom they have given me for
a colleague in the Tribunal?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> The surgeon?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Yes, this ignoramus goes so far as to
make sport of the inclusion of pearls and precious
stones in our remedies; as if it were not proved
every day that sapphires are the principal cures for
ulcers, and emeralds infallible preventatives of pests!

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> Assuredly!

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Between us, this Olivera is to be
watched, Cardenos&mdash;I am sure he believes more in
the devil and witches than he does in medicine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> What is your reason?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Oh! nothing&mdash;He smells of it and I
advise you to watch him&mdash;I said then&mdash;where was
I?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> You spoke of Pétronille.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Ah! yes, my governor! Do you believe
that this wretch would, without consulting
me, let himself be conducted to Zoraya&rsquo;s home?
Seeing him lively and apparently cured, I said:
&ldquo;Ha, my hartshorn powders?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;It was not your powders&mdash;it was a
remedy which the Moorish woman gave me!&mdash;Swindler!
pick up your packets and leave at
once.&rdquo;&mdash;It is better for me to work myself to death
giving my own remedies than to deceive patients
with the kinds which she uses!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> Certainly!&mdash;if it is magic&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> It is magic, Cardenos, do not doubt
it. This sorceress is competing with me dishonestly.
This is not all&mdash;she takes no pay from the poor
for her attention or her medicines. And will you
believe me when I tell you that she sends them
away with their hands full of gold?&mdash;We shall
have to struggle now!&mdash;Our practise is being ruined.

and I were betrothed years ago!&mdash;But I was so sure
she would take the veil and remain in the convent.
After this marriage was arranged contrary
to her wish and my own, I found so many pretexts
for postponing it that further delay would
have roused suspicion. They would have searched
for the reason and found it, perhaps. Then!&mdash;then,
during the last two days when I did not see you, I
resolved to confess all to you.&mdash;This morning I attempted
to tell you&mdash;But I saw you so roused over
a single thought of another woman that I did not
have the courage to cause a scene and withstand
your reproaches, which would have been needless,
as I could not let your tears cause me to forget my
solemn obligations as a Christian, my word as a gentleman
and my most sacred duties.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Yes! All of your duties are sacred

not, that I have considered them as fulfilled?

me with open arms?

and join me in returning faithfully to our love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Oh, indeed!&mdash;More in love than ever!
The contrast of the Moor and the Spaniard! A
variety of pleasures always prevents one&rsquo;s taste from
becoming stale!

do not love her, but I stop you on the threshold
of her room!&mdash;A few paces from her bed!&mdash;I
should scorn myself as a woman of the street if I

is not for you!&mdash;I should curse my eyes if they
gazed for an instant on any other face but yours!&mdash;Where
could I wash away the stain if any other
lips than yours touched mine?&mdash;And it appears natural
for you to be at the same time the husband of
your wife and the lover of your mistress&mdash;to run
from one to the other and to bring to me smiling
the dessert of your nuptial night!&mdash;And it is you
who say to me: &ldquo;Believe nothing, nothing in the
world but my love for you!&rdquo; Ah, coward!&mdash;coward!
liar!&mdash;Here is your love!&mdash;Here it is!

is only the appearance of death!&mdash;She will sleep until
the hour which I have set for her to awaken.&mdash;And
this is your punishment: when she awakens she
will be deaf to your voice, also distant and cold in
your arms!&mdash;You will then understand that your
true wife was not this angelic creature who wanted
no other spouse than God, but the Moor, who gave
you more love in a single clasp of her hand than
this nun in the entire abandonment of her nerveless
body, revolting at your caresses.
</p>

<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>At her feet</i>) What does it matter
to me?&mdash;I shall not dispute with that virgin over

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> Into the Sierra, by paths known only
to us, to the homes of the rebels. Later I shall go
to Africa and find refuge in my father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s
home in Tangier.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And there will be between us the

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Who places himself quickly between</i>

advice, or a threat?

am here by order of the Holy-Office to arrest
this woman (<i>movement by</i> <span class="sc">Enrique</span> <i>to rejoin and

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Foolishness!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> You seem to have forgotten the

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> (<i>Continuing coldly</i>) His Eminence,
knowing that this woman was seen to enter this
house without coming out, entrusted me with the
task of watching at this door to arrest her without
noise when she came out and at the same time
unknown to you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> His Eminence had foreseen that I
would not let you do it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cardenos.</span> He has only foreseen your submission
and confession for the care which he has taken&mdash;out
of regard for your name, your rank, and your
young wife, his pupil&mdash;to separate your case from
that of your accomplice, and inflict upon you only
a penance which will reconcile you with the Church!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Zoraya.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Ah! if that is so, good&mdash;I
will go with you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Violently obstructing her passage</i>)
Are you foolish? (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Cardenos</span>.) Go tell
Ximénès that he has no right to my confession unless
he provides the same indulgence for her whom
he calls my accomplice.

ACT FOUR

<p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>.&mdash;<i>The meeting place of the Tribunal of
the Inquisition. It is a low-vaulted chamber with
ogive arches, lighted with candles. On the walls
are religious paintings. At the foot of the scene
is a narrow glazed window. At the right is a large
high gate closing the entrance of a corridor leading
to the Episcopal palace. On the same side, in the
foreground, are seats of the Tribunal. Facing the
left are an altar and a wooden Calvary. On the
other side of them are an iron door and an arch
leading to the jail. Seats and stools are scattered
about. It is three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. At the
end of the act dawn begins to light the windows.</i>

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> (<i>Advancing into the scene</i>) I have
slept so well after that excellent feast! Nothing
is more injurious to the health than being startlingly
awakened during one&rsquo;s first sleep.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Albornos.</span> What business is so urgent that we
must convene before daybreak?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> (<i>Joining the group at the left</i>) You
Excellencies should have the goodness to tell us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Calabazas.</span> We know no more about it than
you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ibarra.</span> We were greatly surprised at the morning
visit of the agent of the Tribunal. We are
here at the special request of His Eminence to consider
a pressing and serious matter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Albornos.</span> Then you have no idea what it is?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ibarra and Calabazas.</span> None.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Molina</span>, <i>who enters at right</i>)
And you, my reverend father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Molina.</span> No more than you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Calabazas.</span> In any case, I think, without question,
that the two women whom we again examined
after vespers are guilty of sorcery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Molina.</span> Moreover, they confessed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ibarra.</span> That will simplify the task.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> (<i>Seeing</i> <span class="sc">Oliveira</span>, <i>who enters at the
left</i>) Is it not the opinion of my excellent colleague.
Master Oliveira, that there is not sufficient
evidence to condemn them?
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<i>All turn toward</i> <span class="sc">Oliveira</span> <i>with questioning
looks.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Oliveira.</span> Since my very venerable colleague
has obliged me to give my humble opinion, I must
confess that one of the two women, the one called
Afrida, appears to me to be an old fool, who after
having been forced to listen to sorcery and witchcraft,
is possessed with the idea that she is on intimate
terms with a demon. She accepts her dreams
and nightmares as realities and every woman and
girl whom she knows she accuses of having attended
a witches&rsquo; revel. A dozen of these unfortunates
have been placed in our dungeons since yesterday.
If we listened to that vixen all of the women of
Toledo would be sorceresses&mdash;especially the young
ones!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Calabazas.</span> Has she not a reason for accusing
them if she has seen them at these revels?
</p>

<p class="sdright">
<i>Murmurs of discreet approbation.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Oliveira.</span> For her to have seen them, my
father, it would have been necessary for her to
have gone there herself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ibarra.</span> She partook in them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Molina.</span> And you doubt that?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Oliveira.</span> For a good reason!&mdash;As she pretended,
in spite of the confining walls of her dungeons,
to be able to attend the revels again, I determined
to see for myself whether she was telling
the truth. Three times during the night I found
her sleeping deeply on the pallet in her cell in the
prison. When she awoke she told me all that she
thought she had seen at the home of the devil!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Albornos.</span> If you were more experienced in
these matters. Master Oliveira, you would know
that these sorceresses can leave their bodies lying
in their beds and at the same time attend these
Satanic love-feasts.
</p>

<p class="sdright">
<i>Murmurs of approbation.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> And that in the same body the devil
can place one of his imps, who will not change its
appearance.
</p>

<p class="sdright">
<i>Renewed approbation.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Calabazas.</span> And the other sorceress?&mdash;This
young peasant woman from Torrijos, whom they
found in a wood at dawn stretched naked on ground
which had been trampled by infernal dances and
which was still littered with the remains of an
infernal feast and firebrands and ashes&mdash;Master
Oliveira, do you believe she too is innocent?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Oliveira.</span> I have good cause to believe it!&mdash;She
is a poor girl from the fields who was seduced
by her master, who abandoned her and her child
and left them in deep misery. A passing vagrant
invited her to go to a witches&rsquo; meeting where Satan
would provide her with plenty of gold. He took
her to a nocturnal gathering of beggars and ragamuffins,
who with the aid of some rogue put her
into a sleep, from which she awakened at dawn with
the vague memory of horrible debauchery!&mdash;An
orgie! Yes! But witches&rsquo; meeting?&mdash;Who will
prove it?&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> The sigillum or stigma Diaboli, Master
Oliveira! That mark which the devil makes
with his pitchfork, or the horny spots on the bodies
of his creatures, such as we have found, you and
I, in two places on this girl&rsquo;s skin. Our needles
penetrated them without drawing blood and they
were not felt.
</p>

<p class="sdright">
<i>Murmurs of approval.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Oliveira.</span> I found three on the body of the
Superior of the Incarnation, who afterward died in
unquestioned sainthood!
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<i>He walks toward the foot of the stage, followed
by the eyes of the displeased Inquisitors.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Calabazas.</span> (<i>In a low voice</i>) This surgeon
is too much of a reasoner!

it!&mdash;If they listened to him they would burn no
one!

a wooden horse! (<i>She attempts to speak</i>) Enough
of those mummeries. You confessed the other day
of practising evil acts upon your neighbors, causing
their children and fowls to die, of setting fire to
their roofs and sending hail upon their fields.

then. Gee-up! gee-up! across the fields, accompanied
by the sound of bells to where they are assembling.
There the great devil Astaroth, on seeing
me, says: &ldquo;Ah! here is my little Afrida! Come,
mignon, come here that I may pet you!&rdquo; For she
loves me above all and always says: &ldquo;Go, fear
nothing, my little chicken. If they want to burn
you, I shall drag away the wood before all the
world. And we shall laugh then. Oh! we shall
laugh well! Ah! how we shall laugh then!&rdquo;

I was to become a mother&mdash;for he was the father
of the child. I was too weak to work in the fields

woman conducted me into a wood where many men

gave me food and drink and more and more of&mdash;I
know not what kind of liquor&mdash;until I became like
a fool!&mdash;And after!&mdash;Ah! God, no, oh! no, I cannot
relate that!&mdash;In the morning I lay asleep on the
ground, poorer than before, for my miserable, ragged
clothes were gone! The archers threw me into a
dungeon, where I have done nothing but shed tears
day and night, thinking of my poor little baby! I
do not know what has become of that! They will
not tell me! (<i>Sobbing</i>) Ah! my good lords, do not
make me more miserable! If they intend to burn

such a desert of the flowery plain of Granada that
a bee cannot gather honey upon it! But that was
not enough for us&mdash;we must have misery, famine
and the brutality of soldiers! There must be refined
cruelty at least, so you invented the Inquisition.&mdash;Thanks
to that, you can assure yourselves
with joyful hearts that we are punished like hardened
heathens, that we perish in your oubliettes and
that we are burned alive in the name of your Savior,
who taught only mercy and goodness! (<i>Pointing

ACT FIVE

<p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Before the Door of the Lions of the
Cathedral of Toledo. At the right, the portal in
front of which are a number of steps. In the
foreground, an alley. There are two other alleys:
one very narrow, but passable, leads obliquely past
the church; the other, at the left, faces the scene,
is wider and sloping. At the left, in the foreground,
is a house beyond which is a street and a
pyre for burning victims. It is near the close of day
and the heavens are red with the glow of the setting
sun. Two archers guard the pyre. Two
others stand at the entrances of the alleys at the
foot of the stage.</i>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Ramiro</span>) Is there anything

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> Yes, good news!&mdash;His Lordship is

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Rufina and Doña Syrena.</span> Ah! so
much the better!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> His Eminence has gone to carry the
news to the king, leaving, as always, his business
in secular hands&mdash;that is to say, leaving His Excellency,
the Governor, the task of fulfilling the
sentence:&mdash;for the Church will not spill blood!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Where is Don Enrique?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ramiro.</span> At this moment, I do not know.
(<span class="sc">Cleofas</span> <i>comes out of the church with two persons,

coming out of the church. He will tell you. (<i>He
calls.</i>) Master Cleofas!

<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Ah! at your service! (<i>He approaches.</i>)
Charming ladies!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>

Enrique.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Saved, by the grace of God!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Ambrosio.</span> Was he released without punishment?
</p>

<p class="sdinfo">
<i>The young men form in groups round</i> <span class="sc">Cleofas</span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Pardoned!&mdash;This evening he will enter
the Franciscan cloisters to do penance for three
months. He will live on bread and water, wear
hair-cloth and sleep on cinders.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Rufina.</span> That is a jolly honeymoon!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Fabia.</span> And what does his young wife

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Doña Joana?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Fabia and Doña Rufina.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> She says nothing! Since yesterday
she has been in such a deep sleep that they cannot
awaken her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> (<i>Turning</i>) Since yesterday! Is that
possible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> His Excellency, the Governor, was
rejoicing this morning because his daughter knew
nothing of what had happened during the night.
But they are now very much concerned. She had
these sleeps in the convent. But this is a longer
sleep than the others, they say. Cleofas is the only
one to work over her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> Naturally.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Naturally!&mdash;I cannot make her show
a sign of awakening.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">All.</span> Ah!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Pinchings, prickings! I have tried
everything except the red-hot iron, to which His
Excellency objects! Pain has vanished! As the
Mooress has bewitched the poor child, my art is
ineffective. I have advised the only effective remedy:
exorcism in the same church, before the highest
altar. (<i>They hear the chants of young girls.</i>)
His Excellency and Don Enrique have had the
patient carried into it&mdash;and they are praying that
the demon which possesses her will be chased away.
Master Oliveira, whom I left there, will be likely
to profit and become an exorciser himself.
</p>

<p class="sdright">

<p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Doña Syrena.</span> Without seeing them burn the
Sorceress?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Cleofas.</span> Pooh! I have seen such things as
those so often that I no longer find them tasteful.
</p>

the arrival of this creature?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Guilty as she is, I have loved her
too well not to pity her. Tell Torillo to come
here and consult with me. (<span class="sc">Ramiro</span> <i>speaks in a

the person who compels the condemned ones to
mount the pyres?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> Yes, my lord, and I also light the
fires.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> How can you sleep after doing such
work?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> From habit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> You often save the victims from the
horror of being burned alive, do you not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> Yes, when the Holy Tribunal gives
orders to strangle them and attach them to the
stake!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> You have not received such an order
for her?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> No, my lord.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> They tell me that the parents or
friends of the condemned frequently ask such a
favor of you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> It is true, my lord.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And do you consent to give it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> For charity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> And for your own advantage, also?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> Those are my little profits.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> That must be done for her.&mdash;What
price have you set upon such concessions?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> I shall leave that to the judgment
of Your Grace. But, being an honest man, I must
tell you that a similar request has been made.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> By whom?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> By a woman-servant, she told me, in
the service of the condemned.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Aisha?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> I do not know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Has she paid you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> She has given me ten ducats for
agreeing to give to the Mooress a little waxen pill
the instant that I untie her hands for public penance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Yes! yes! I understand!&mdash;You
have consented?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> I promised without fully deciding to
do so! But, now that Your Grace desires it
also&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> Ah! God, yes!&mdash;and you shall have
a thousand ducats tomorrow!
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> The bargain is concluded, señor.
</p>

<p class="sdright">
<i>He turns to go.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> (<i>Detaining him with a gesture</i>)
But how can you prove to me that you will keep
your promise?
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Torillo.</span> Because the victim will not utter a
cry when I set fire to the pyre; if she restrains then
she is dead.
</p>

<p>
<span class="spk">Enrique.</span> If she is unable to utter a cry, or
a groan, I will double the sum.

him.</i>) Don Enrique, you are a man who can rely

magicians, you and me!

under a mantle of rich material ornamented
with white flowers. The chair is
deposited at the foot of the steps. The
crowd, murmuring with interest and curiosity,
draws near. Far in the church
women are singing a canticle. Profound
silence follows. All the assistants go forward,
stretching their necks to see the
women of the first rank. The nuns, the
young girls, and</i> <span class="sc">Fatoum</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Padilla</span> <i>on

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
